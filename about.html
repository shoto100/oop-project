                                        <p class="information">The practice of charity means the voluntary giving of help to those in need, as a humanitarian act. There are a number of philosophies about charity, often associated with religion.
                                            Charitable giving is the act of giving money, goods or time to the unfortunate, either directly or by means of a charitable trust or other worthy cause.
                                            
                                            Charity is not a new term in our society. From the history we know that there is always groups of people suffering from various problem. And there is also groups of people to help them. Nowadays we can see people collecting and distributing charity donation from small to wide range.
                                            
                                            Charity can be collected personally, socially, nationally  or even internationally. To use the full potential of a charity project we need to make it digitalized. Which will make giving, collecting and distributing charity much easier and effective. 
                                            That is the motto of our project.</p>

So I’m keenly interested about this System designing task. And I look forward to contributing my skill in this project . I’ll try my best for this project . And last but not least thank you to our honourable teacher for giving me this opportunity to work on this project .</p>
