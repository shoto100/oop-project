                                <p>Our customer, Charity-Global is currently managing the donations to coordinate the amount to be given as donations by using a manual system. To run the activities successfully, they are required to do the manual registration. The list of the philanthropists along with their donations are done manually using forms, logbooks and registers. This leads to numerous problems, as information sharing becomes slow, difficulties in making quick brief summary reports, difficulty to manage a large queue of volunteers, also having problems in applicants and members management etc. Our customer wants a software solution to this problem.</p>

                            <div class="col-md-12 project">

                                <h4>2. PROBLEM STATEMENT</h4>
                                <p>The donation registration is a primary task for the Charity-Global. Here, the important issue is the applicant’s management and donation management process. It is a difficult task to manage and fill-up a form for applicants to donate and the donation amount manually. They are numerous ways to solve this issue using software system and applicants can register quickly rather than manual system.
                                  In the manual applicant registration system, there are many redundant of works by keeping the same record in members or volunteers profile. By using software system, it is possible to reduce these redundant works and accelerate the activities.
                                  They also found difficulties in member’s management task. A member management software system can easily these artifacts and all the members’ information properly.
                                  At this charity organization, there are several activities where our customers are facing difficulties like how the volunteers can register themselves, how the applicants can register themselves, how the members can donate by logging into their id, how the donation amount is managed and how the admin works. These all tasks can be made easy for our customers using the software.
                                  They also need proper guideline and suggestion about the hardware requirement and network architect as per software system requirement. Hardware requirement and network architecture will be suggested considering their existing hardware equipment and network architecture.</p>
